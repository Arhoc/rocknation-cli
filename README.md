# rocknation-cli
Experimental CLI tool to interact with rocknation.su written in C

Since this is just experimental for now, there could be changes, i'm working on a GUI On-Streaming too.

```[USAGE]
./rocknation-cli <option> <argument_to_option>

[OPTIONS]
        search-band <NAME>
        list-albums <BAND_URL>
        download-song <URL> [OUTPUT_FILE]
        download-album <URL> [OUTPUT_FOLDER]
```
